      Made with <strong>HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript ES6,</strong> hosted on an
      <strong>Apache2 webserver</strong>, and DNS registered through <strong>Google
      Domains</strong>, it's my little corner of the internet to share what I have
      working on.</h2>

      <h2>Technical Details: This website is written entirely by me, and I learned
      everything in my own time. I started out with just a few HTML files, but it
      quickly grew as I added more about myself. Now, it includes 5 HTML files (one
      of which contains some PHP), 7 CSS files, and 5 Javascript files, cumulating
      to a total of over 1000 lines of code.</h2>
      <h2>Of course, HTML and CSS are not technically
      programming languages, rather markup languages. Nevertheless, I still consider
      it within the same vein, and completing a proper web dev project is still a big step in a
      larger computer science dream.</h2>

      <h2>As far as hosting goes, I have a free tier account with Oracle Cloud
      Infrastructure, and run a <strong>4 OCPU 24 GB of RAM server</strong>,
      and <strong>Ubuntu 20.04.</strong> This server has been an excellent practice
      in not only using alternative operating systems to Windows, but also as a
      practice in system administration. Everything you see has been served by an
      <strong>Apache 2 webserver</strong></h2>
